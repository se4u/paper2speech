Shim between pdftotext and text to speech for conference papers.
Removes line numbers, page numbers, adds Title and Section markers
and handles hyphens to make the speech output more fluent.

TODO:
- Make sure to not lose any text, currently font 8 is lost.
- Handle Math Expressions.
- Easily transfer created files.
- Create a simple UI that can let me jump to sections.
